title: >-
  EVT-MinHash: Extreme Value Theory for Statistically Principled Confidence Intervals in MinHash-Based Near-Duplicate Detection
hypothesis: >-
  For short text documents, the distribution of MinHash signature values follows a Gumbel distribution (Extreme Value Type
  I) because MinHash computes the minimum of hash values across shingles. By modeling this distribution explicitly using Extreme
  Value Theory (EVT), we can derive closed-form confidence intervals and hypothesis tests for Jaccard similarity estimates
  that are more accurate and computationally efficient than bootstrap-based methods, especially in the small-sample regime
  where short documents produce few shingles.
motivation: >-
  Near-duplicate detection using MinHash is fundamentally a statistical estimation problem, yet current approaches lack statistically
  principled uncertainty quantification. For short text documents (tweets, SMS, titles), the small number of shingles leads
  to high-variance Jaccard estimates, and practitioners must rely on heuristics or computationally expensive bootstrap methods
  to assess confidence. The core mechanism of MinHash—computing the minimum of random hash values—directly connects to Extreme
  Value Theory, which provides the asymptotic distribution of minima. This cross-disciplinary transfer from mathematical statistics
  to near-duplicate detection enables rigorous uncertainty quantification with minimal computational overhead, making it practical
  for large-scale deduplication pipelines where short text is common.
assumptions:
- >-
  Hash functions produce approximately uniformly distributed values in [0,1] for randomly selected shingles
- >-
  The number of shingles in short text documents (10-100) is sufficient for the asymptotic Gumbel distribution to provide
  a reasonable approximation
- >-
  Shingles within a document can be treated as approximately independent samples for the purpose of modeling the distribution
  of minima
- >-
  The computational overhead of EVT-based confidence intervals is negligible compared to the MinHash computation itself
investigation_approach: >-
  1. Derive the theoretical connection between MinHash and the Gumbel distribution by modeling MinHash values as order statistics
  of independent random variables. 2. Develop closed-form expressions for confidence intervals of Jaccard similarity estimates
  using the delta method applied to the Gumbel distribution parameters. 3. Implement EVT-MinHash and compare against standard
  MinHash with bootstrap confidence intervals on short text datasets (tweets, SMS, news headlines). 4. Evaluate on three axes:
  (a) coverage probability (do 95% CI actually contain true Jaccard 95% of the time?), (b) interval width (are EVT intervals
  tighter?), and (c) computational cost. 5. Test the hypothesis that EVT-based intervals achieve better coverage with lower
  computational cost than bootstrap alternatives for documents with fewer than 100 shingles.
success_criteria: >-
  The EVT-based confidence intervals should: (1) Achieve coverage probability within 2% of the nominal level (e.g., 95±2%
  for nominal 95% CI) on held-out test data, (2) Be computationally cheaper than bootstrap (no resampling required), and (3)
  Produce narrower intervals than bootstrap with the same coverage for short documents (<50 shingles). Additionally, a hypothesis
  test derived from the EVT framework should correctly control false positive rate at the specified alpha level when comparing
  document pairs.
related_works:
- >-
  LSHBloom (arXiv 2411.04257, 2024): Proposes architectural improvements to MinHashLSH using Bloom filters for internet-scale
  deduplication. Our work differs fundamentally by focusing on the statistical properties of the MinHash estimator itself
  (using EVT) rather than indexing optimizations. LSHBloom does not provide confidence intervals or hypothesis tests for Jaccard
  estimates.
- >-
  Sampling-Based Estimation of Jaccard Containment and Similarity (arXiv 2507.10019, 2025): Derives likelihood models and
  posterior error bounds for Jaccard estimation from samples. Our work differs by using Extreme Value Theory to model the
  distribution of MinHash values directly, providing closed-form confidence intervals without requiring posterior sampling.
  The core mechanism (EVT vs. Bayesian posterior) is fundamentally different.
- >-
  Debiasing FracMinHash and deriving confidence intervals (biorxiv 2022.01.11.475870): Derives confidence intervals for FracMinHash
  in bioinformatics applications. Our work differs by (a) using EVT/Gumbel distribution as the theoretical foundation rather
  than the normal approximation, (b) focusing specifically on short text documents where the small-sample properties matter
  most, and (c) providing a hypothesis testing framework, not just confidence intervals.
- >-
  SetSketch: Filling the Gap between MinHash and HyperLogLog (VLDB 2021): Uses Gumbel distribution for cardinality estimation,
  not for Jaccard similarity confidence intervals. Our work transfers this EVT insight to the similarity estimation problem,
  which requires different theoretical treatment since we are modeling the joint distribution of two MinHash signatures, not
  a single set's cardinality.
- >-
  Weighted MinHash algorithms (arXiv 1811.04633): Focuses on extending MinHash to weighted sets using various sampling strategies.
  Our work is orthogonal—we use standard MinHash but add EVT-based uncertainty quantification, which is compatible with weighted
  variants but addresses a different problem (uncertainty vs. weighting).
inspiration: >-
  The hypothesis draws from three cross-domain inspirations: (1) Extreme Value Theory from mathematical statistics—the Fisher-Tippett-Gnedenko
  theorem states that the minimum of i.i.d. random variables converges to a Gumbel distribution, which directly applies to
  MinHash's minimum operation. (2) Order statistics from probability theory—MinHash signatures are essentially order statistics
  (the minimum) of transformed random variables. (3) The delta method from statistical theory—used to propagate uncertainty
  from the Gumbel parameters to the Jaccard similarity estimate. The key insight is that MinHash is not just a heuristic algorithm
  but a statistical estimator whose sampling distribution can be characterized analytically using EVT.
terms:
- term: MinHash
  definition: >-
    A locality-sensitive hashing algorithm that estimates Jaccard similarity between sets by comparing the minimum hash values
    of their elements. It works by applying multiple hash functions to each set and keeping only the minimum hash value for
    each function, producing a signature that preserves similarity.
- term: Jaccard Similarity
  definition: >-
    A similarity coefficient between two sets A and B defined as |A∩B|/|A∪B|, ranging from 0 (disjoint sets) to 1 (identical
    sets). For near-duplicate detection, higher Jaccard similarity indicates greater overlap between documents.
- term: Extreme Value Theory (EVT)
  definition: >-
    A branch of statistics dealing with the extreme deviations from the median of probability distributions. The Fisher-Tippett-Gnedenko
    theorem states that the minimum (or maximum) of i.i.d. random variables converges to one of three distributions: Gumbel,
    Fréchet, or Weibull. For MinHash (which uses minima of continuous random variables), the Gumbel distribution applies.
- term: Gumbel Distribution
  definition: >-
    A probability distribution of extreme values (minima or maxima) also known as the Extreme Value Type I distribution. It
    has location parameter μ and scale parameter σ. The CDF is F(x) = exp(-exp(-(x-μ)/σ)). For MinHash, the distribution of
    minimum hash values across shingles converges to Gumbel as the number of shingles increases.
- term: Shingle
  definition: >-
    A contiguous subsequence of tokens or characters from a document, used as a fingerprint. A k-shingle is a subsequence
    of length k. For example, the 3-shingles of 'abcde' are 'abc', 'bcd', 'cde'. The set of all shingles from a document represents
    its content for similarity comparison.
- term: Confidence Interval
  definition: >-
    A range of values derived from sample data that is likely to contain the true population parameter with a specified probability
    (confidence level). For MinHash, a 95% confidence interval for Jaccard similarity means that if we repeated the sampling
    process many times, 95% of such intervals would contain the true Jaccard similarity.
- term: Near-Duplicate Detection
  definition: >-
    The task of identifying pairs of documents that are approximately identical (e.g., different versions of the same article,
    copied content with minor modifications). Unlike exact deduplication, near-duplicate detection tolerates small differences
    in wording, formatting, or structure.
summary: >-
  By modeling MinHash signature values using Extreme Value Theory (Gumbel distribution), we can derive closed-form confidence
  intervals and hypothesis tests for Jaccard similarity estimates that are more accurate and computationally efficient than
  bootstrap methods, especially for short text documents with few shingles.

No experiments have been run yet — evaluate the hypothesis purely on its merits.
</review_context>





<task>
Provide a thorough peer review of this research hypothesis.

STEP 1 — GROUND YOUR REVIEW IN EVIDENCE:
Before writing critiques, search for relevant context to make your review authoritative:
- Search for accepted papers at top venues in this area — what level of
  contribution gets accepted? How does this hypothesis compare?
- Search for the closest existing work — is this genuinely novel or incremental?
- Check if the proposed methodology has known failure modes in the literature

STEP 2 — WRITE YOUR REVIEW:
For each critique:
1. Categorize: methodology, evidence, novelty, clarity, scope, or rigor
2. Rate severity: major (would waste compute if not fixed) or minor (polish)
3. Describe the issue clearly
4. Suggest a concrete action to address it

Focus on the most impactful issues. Flag fatal flaws that would waste compute if not fixed first.

STABILITY IS OK: If the hypothesis is on track and just needs more iterations to prove itself,
keep your feedback similar to the previous round. Don't manufacture new critiques — only escalate
when the revision introduced new issues or failed to address prior ones.

STEP 3 — H↔H EDGE:
This is the first iteration — there is no previous hypothesis. Leave
``relation_type`` null and ``relation_rationale`` empty.

Provide your review via structured output.

description: "Comprehensive web research toolkit — use whenever a task needs MORE than a handful of WebSearch/WebFetch calls (multi-source literature reviews, deep verification across many pages, paper/PDF mining, cross-referencing claims, building bibliographies). Not for single quick lookups — use raw WebSearch/WebFetch for those. Adds aii_web_tools__fetch_grep for exact regex extraction over HTML or PDFs (arXiv, journals) with context windows, beyond what WebFetch's lossy summary returns.

---

## Available Web Tools

Three levels of web tools:

1. **WebSearch** — broad discovery. Returns titles, URLs, snippets. Cheapest. Use first to scan the landscape.
2. **WebFetch** — read a specific page. LLM summarizes it. HTML only. May miss specific details.
3. **aii_web_tools__fetch_grep** — exact text extraction from HTML or PDF. Regex matching with context windows.
   Use for precise details, methodology, or when WebFetch missed something.
   Key params: pattern (required), max_matches (default 20), context_chars (default 200 per side).

**Workflow:** WebSearch → WebFetch for gist → aii_web_tools__fetch_grep for exact details or PDFs.

**If the script fails** with a connection error (ability server not running): create a local `.venv`, install server deps from `server_requirements.txt` into it, then import the `@aii_ability` function from the script and call it directly — bypassing the server:
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-web-research-tools"
uv venv .venv --python=3.12 && uv pip install --python=.venv/bin/python -r "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/server_requirements.txt"

name: aii-web-tools
description: "Web research toolkit: web search (Serper/Google), web page fetch as markdown (HTML and PDF), and regex grep over full page/PDF text. Use whenever a task needs to search the web, read a page, mine a paper/PDF, verify citations, or extract exact quotes, numbers, or methodology from a URL."
---

## Web tools

You have three web capabilities: **search**, **fetch**, and **grep** (exact
regex extraction over a full page or PDF).

**Pick where they come from, in this order:**

1. **If you have built-in `WebSearch` / `WebFetch` tools, PREFER those over the
   scripts below.** They may be **deferred tools** (listed by name but with
   schemas not yet loaded) — if so, call `ToolSearch("select:WebSearch,WebFetch")`
   ONCE to load them, then use them normally. Do not skip them just because they
   need that one extra load step; they are the preferred path. Pair them with the
   `aii_web_tools__fetch_grep` script below when you need exact text / numbers /
   methodology that a summary would miss, or when reading a PDF.
2. **Only if you have NO built-in `WebSearch` / `WebFetch`** (e.g. the OpenHands
   backend), use the scripts in this skill (below). They are our own
   implementations — Serper.dev for search, html2text + PyMuPDF for fetch, and
   regex grep over the full document text. They work without any built-in web
   tools.

Workflow either way: **search** (discover) → **fetch** (read for the gist) →
**grep** (pull exact details / read PDFs).

---

## Running the scripts

Run every script with the skill's pre-provisioned interpreter (it already has
`requests`, `html2text`, `pymupdf`, `python-dotenv`). Set `PY` once:

```bash
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-web-tools"
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python"
```

### 1. Search the web (Serper.dev / Google)

```bash
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_search.py" --query "neuro-symbolic FOL translation LLM" --max-results 10
```

Returns ranked title / URL / snippet lines. Use it first to scan the
landscape; snippets are for discovery only — fetch a page before judging it.

### 2. Fetch a page as markdown (HTML or PDF)

```bash
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_fetch.py" fetch --url "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11366" --max-chars 10000
```

`--max-chars` caps output (default 10000); `--char-offset N` pages further in.
Handles PDFs transparently via PyMuPDF.

### 3. Grep a page or PDF (exact regex extraction)

```bash
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_fetch.py" grep --url "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.11366" --pattern "verbal reinforcement" --max-matches 20 --context-chars 200
```

Returns only the matching sections with surrounding context — the right tool
for exact numbers, table values, methodology, or long PDFs where a summary
would lose the detail. `-i` for case-insensitive.

**Parallelize** independent searches/fetches in one turn; only sequence a
fetch after the search that produced its URL.

---

## Notes

- The scripts call our ability server. If a script prints
  `Ability service not available`, the server is down — say so rather than
  silently improvising a different search method.
- Do **not** hand-roll your own `requests`/scraping for search when these
  tools are available: Serper returns clean Google results and the fetch/grep
  scripts already handle HTML, PDFs, and encoding.
